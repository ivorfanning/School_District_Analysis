Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

However, the school board found that the data from Thomas High School's 9th grade class was altered after reviewing all the data, so the school board asked for the 9th grade data of Thomas High School to be removed and do the analysis again.

After the re-analysis, the results are:
