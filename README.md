# Project Overview and purpose

The school board asked for a summary of key metrics by each school name and by the district level in their area. The main analysis focused on the performance of math and reading scores. However, the school board found that the data from Thomas High School's 9th grade class was altered after reviewing all the data, so the school board asked for the 9th grade data of Thomas High School to be removed and do the analysis again.

## Re-analysis results:
